# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this lenear regression model?

The r2 value is a value used to show how likely the dependent varialble can be predicted from the independent variable it is a value between 0 and 1 and the closer the value is to 1 the more likely that the dependent varible can be predicted from the independent variable.

2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person iwho is 43 years old?

Someone who is 43 years old has a predicted blood pressure of 137.462

3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?

I feel that this model is not that accurate because it only factors age and nothing else into the prediction and if you only using the persons age then yes this might work but if you are trying to pridict a persons blood pressure using more detaikled things this prediction would not work and to make it work you would have to use multiple independent factors
