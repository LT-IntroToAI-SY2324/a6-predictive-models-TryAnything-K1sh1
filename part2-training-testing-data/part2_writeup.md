# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?

This model is more effective because we can test how well our model would work as a prediction and not just if it could graph what we needed because we are able to see how well our predictions can work with new data

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?

The rsquared coefficient can help you predic how accurate this model would be if you were to give it random data.

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.

I would say out model is semi accurate because the similarity between the predicted value and the actual values given were similar, the meaning of the predicted values in the context of the chart below is the blood pressure guess we would get for the given age using previous data while the actual value is what the persons actual blood pressure is.
